# 🟣 Onboarding Guide – TOVO  
Welcome to **TOVO – Digital Order Management Tracker** 🎉  
This short guide will help you get started in less than 2 minutes.


## ✨ What is TOVO?
TOVO is a **lightweight, offline-first order tracker** designed for individuals and small businesses.  
It helps you **add, manage, and complete orders** with a clean dashboard showing Total, Completed, and Pending orders.



## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Open TOVO
- Download or clone the project.  
- Go to the `frontend/` folder.  
- Double-click **`index.html`** to open it in your browser.  
✅ No server or installation needed. Works offline.


### 2. Add Your First Order
1. Go to the **Add New Order** form.  
2. Enter:
   - **Order Name** – e.g., *Blue T-shirt*  
   - **Description** – optional notes  
   - **Price** – e.g., *20*  
   - **Stock** – e.g., *15*  
3. Click **Add Order**.  
Your order will appear instantly in the **Your Orders** list.


### 3. Track Your Orders
- **Pending Orders** → Newly added orders.  
- **Completed Orders** → Mark an order as done by clicking the ✅ button.  
- **Delete Orders** → Click the 🗑️ trash button to remove an order.  

The dashboard stats (Total, Completed, Pending) update automatically.


### 4. Offline Mode
- All your data is stored in your browser using **localStorage**.  
- This means TOVO works **with or without internet access**.  
- When you reopen the app, your orders will still be there.


## 🧠 AI Features (Planned)
While the MVP works without AI, TOVO’s roadmap includes:
- Predictive insights → *“Which orders are likely to be delayed?”*  
- Restock suggestions → *“Stock for Blue T-shirts is running low.”*  
- Natural language entry → *“Add 10 red caps at $15 each.”*  


## 💡 Tips for Best Use
- Keep your browser updated for the best experience.  
- Use desktop or mobile browsers — TOVO adapts to screen size.  
- For a fresh start, clear your browser’s localStorage (⚠ this deletes all saved orders).
